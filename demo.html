    <h1>Inline.js - Inline Testing in Javascript</h1>
    
    <p>Inline.js allows you to append unit tests onto function declarations inline in code, such as:</p>
    <pre>var square = function(n) { return n * n; }.where(3).shouldEqual(9);</pre>
    
    <p>It was inspired by the article <a href="http://sergimansilla.com/blog/extending-js-inline-unit-tests/">Extending JavaScript with inline unit tests</a> by Sergi Mansilla, which uses macros to achieve a similar result.</p>
    
    <p>View the source of this page to see a couple of simple functions tested, and check out the console to see the results of the failed assertions.</p>
    
    <p>Inline.js is only a quick experiment, and I wouldn’t really recommend mixing tests and code, but I do think there’s something interesting about inline testing, and could see it being used for teaching or demonstration purposes.
